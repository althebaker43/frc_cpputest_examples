FRC C++ unit testing examples with CppUTest

This example, based on the 'Arcade Drive' sample project in Eclipse, is split up into three projects:

1. Main robot code project ('Arcade Drive')
2. Unit test project ('Arcade Drive Test')
3. Mock WPILib project ('MockWPILib')

To learn how to set up unit tests for your own FRC C++ project, see [this blog post](http://www.botbakery.net/2016/03/unit-testing-frc-c-with-cpputest-in.html).
